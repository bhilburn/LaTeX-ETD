# LaTeX-ETD
This is a LaTeX template for theses and dissertations that generates ready-to-submit ETD documents, and provides example LaTeX code.

## What is this?
As of the early 2000s, many universities began instituting requirements for new theses and dissertations to be in the 'Electronic Theses and Dissertations' (ETD) format. The goal of ETD is to make it easier for theses and dissertations to be made available online and searched. Most universities that require ETD-formatted documents provide templates for LaTeX, Word, or both. 

While writing my own thesis, I found the university-provided LaTEX template to be less-than-ideal. So, I created my own. Since then, it has been used by a number of other grad students, and it seems to be working well.

## Features
* Heavily, *heavily* commented to hopefully make things easier for you.
* Imports many LaTeX modules that you will likely need (images, equations, etc.,)
* Imposes the standard ETD formatting rules - your document will like fantastic!
* Properly sets all of the PDF fields, so generated PDFs will have correct meta-data and links.
* The file itself includes demonstrations of common document features, such as a 'List of Figures', 'List of Images', 'Works Cited', and few other items.
